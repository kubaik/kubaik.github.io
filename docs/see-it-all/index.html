<h3 id="example-using-prometheus-and-grafana">Example: Using Prometheus and Grafana</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at an example of using Prometheus and Grafana to monitor a simple web application. We'll use a Python Flask application as an example, and collect metrics data using the Prometheus client library.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">prometheus_client</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">start_http_server</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Counter</span>

<span class="c1"># Create a counter metric</span>
<span class="n">counter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Counter</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;my_app_requests&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Number of requests&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Start the Prometheus server</span>
<span class="n">start_http_server</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8000</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Define a route for our application</span>
<span class="nd">@app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c1"># Increment the counter metric</span>
    <span class="n">counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inc</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Hello World!&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example, we're using the Prometheus client library to collect metrics data about the number of requests to our application. We're then using Grafana to visualize this data in a custom dashboard.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Create a Grafana dashboard</span>
<span class="n">dashboard</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;rows&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Requests&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
            <span class="s1">&#39;panels&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
                <span class="p">{</span>
                    <span class="s1">&#39;id&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span>
                    <span class="s1">&#39;title&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;Requests per second&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                    <span class="s1">&#39;query&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;rate(my_app_requests[1m])&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                    <span class="s1">&#39;type&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;graph&#39;</span>
                <span class="p">}</span>
            <span class="p">]</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example, we're using the New Relic Java agent to record an error in our application. We can then use the New Relic dashboard to visualize this data and detect errors in real-time.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gu">### New Relic Pricing</span>
