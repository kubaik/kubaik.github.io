</ul>
<h3 id="example-implementing-prometheus-and-grafana">Example: Implementing Prometheus and Grafana</h3>
<p>To demonstrate the power of monitoring and observability, let's consider an example implementation using Prometheus and Grafana. Suppose we have a simple web application written in Python using the Flask framework. We can use Prometheus to collect metrics from the application and Grafana to visualize the data.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>

<span class="nd">@app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">index</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c1"># Increment the counter for each request</span>
    <span class="n">requests_counter</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inc</span><span class="p">()</span>
