<p>Monitoring and observability are essential components of modern software development, allowing teams to ensure their applications are performing as expected and identify potential issues before they become critical. In this article, we will delve into the world of monitoring and observability, exploring the tools, techniques, and best practices used to gain visibility into complex systems.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-monitoring">What is Monitoring?</h3>
<p>Monitoring refers to the process of collecting and analyzing data from applications and infrastructure to detect anomalies, errors, or performance degradation. This can include metrics such as CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency, and error rates. Effective monitoring enables teams to respond quickly to issues, reducing downtime and improving overall system reliability.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-observability">What is Observability?</h3>
<p>Observability takes monitoring to the next level by providing a deeper understanding of system behavior. It involves collecting and analyzing data from multiple sources, including logs, metrics, and traces, to gain insights into how systems interact and behave. Observability helps teams to identify the root cause of issues, optimize system performance, and improve overall user experience.</p>
<h2 id="tools-and-platforms-for-monitoring-and-observability">Tools and Platforms for Monitoring and Observability</h2>
