                    <h2 id="introduction-to-functional-programming">Introduction to Functional Programming</h2>
<p>Functional programming (FP) is a programming paradigm that has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to simplify code, reduce bugs, and improve performance. At its core, FP is about writing code that is composable, reusable, and easy to reason about. In this article, we will delve into the basics of FP, exploring its key concepts, benefits, and use cases.</p>
<h3 id="key-concepts-in-functional-programming">Key Concepts in Functional Programming</h3>
<p>Some of the key concepts in FP include:
* <strong>Immutable Data</strong>: Immutable data structures are essential in FP, as they ensure that data is not modified accidentally, making it easier to reason about code.
* <strong>Pure Functions</strong>: Pure functions are functions that have no side effects and always return the same output given the same input. This makes them predictable and easy to test.
* <strong>Recursion</strong>: Recursion is a fundamental concept in FP, where a function calls itself to solve a problem.
* <strong>Higher-Order Functions</strong>: Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as output.</p>
<h2 id="practical-code-examples">Practical Code Examples</h2>
<p>To illustrate these concepts, let's consider a few practical code examples. We will use JavaScript as our programming language, and Node.js as our platform.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-immutable-data">Example 1: Immutable Data</h3>
<p>In JavaScript, we can use the <code>Object.freeze()</code> method to create immutable objects. Here's an example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">immutablePerson</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">Object</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">freeze</span><span class="p">({</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;John Doe&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">age</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">30</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="k">try</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">immutablePerson</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;Jane Doe&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">catch</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">error</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// Output: Cannot assign to read only property &#39;name&#39; of object &#39;[object Object]&#39;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As we can see, attempting to modify the <code>immutablePerson</code> object results in an error, demonstrating the immutability of the object.</p>
<h3 id="example-2-pure-functions">Example 2: Pure Functions</h3>
<p>Here's an example of a pure function in JavaScript:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">b</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">));</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// Output: 5</span>
<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">3</span><span class="p">));</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// Output: 5</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>add</code> function is a pure function because it has no side effects and always returns the same output given the same input.</p>
<h3 id="example-3-recursion">Example 3: Recursion</h3>
<p>Here's an example of a recursive function in JavaScript:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">n</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">n</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">===</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">else</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">n</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">n</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">factorial</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">5</span><span class="p">));</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">// Output: 120</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>factorial</code> function is a recursive function because it calls itself to solve the problem.</p>
