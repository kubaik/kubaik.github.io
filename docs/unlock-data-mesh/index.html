<h3 id="real-world-example-implementing-data-mesh-with-apache-kafka-and-apache-spark">Real-World Example: Implementing Data Mesh with Apache Kafka and Apache Spark</h3>
<p>Let's consider a real-world example of implementing Data Mesh using Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. Suppose we have a e-commerce company that wants to build a Data Mesh to provide real-time insights into customer behavior.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Kafka producer configuration</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">kafka</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">KafkaProducer</span>
<span class="n">producer</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">KafkaProducer</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">bootstrap_servers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;localhost:9092&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Send customer data to Kafka topic</span>
<span class="n">customer_data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s1">&#39;customer_id&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">123</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;order_total&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mf">100.0</span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="n">producer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;customer_data&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">value</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">customer_data</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example, we use Apache Kafka to stream customer data from various sources, such as website interactions, mobile app usage, and customer feedback. We then use Apache Spark to process the data and create data products, such as customer segmentation and order forecasting.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Spark configuration</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">pyspark.sql</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">SparkSession</span>

<span class="c1"># Process customer data and create data products</span>
<span class="n">customer_segmentation_df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">customer_data_df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">groupBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;customer_id&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">agg</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s1">&#39;order_total&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sum&#39;</span><span class="p">})</span>
<span class="n">order_forecasting_df</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">customer_data_df</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">groupBy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;order_total&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">agg</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="s1">&#39;customer_id&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">&#39;count&#39;</span><span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div>
