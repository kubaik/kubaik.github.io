                    <h2 id="introduction-to-open-source-contribution">Introduction to Open Source Contribution</h2>
<p>Open source contribution is the process of contributing code, documentation, or other forms of support to open source projects. These projects are typically hosted on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, and are maintained by a community of developers who collaborate to improve the project. Contributing to open source projects can be a great way to gain experience, build a network of peers, and give back to the community.</p>
<p>To get started with open source contribution, you'll need to have a basic understanding of version control systems like Git. You can use tools like GitHub Desktop or Git Kraken to interact with Git repositories. Additionally, you'll need to have a code editor or IDE like Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how to configure Visual Studio Code to use the TensorFlow coding style:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># settings.json</span>
<span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;editor.fontSize&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;editor.fontFamily&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Monaco&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;python.formatting.provider&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;yapf&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">&quot;python.formatting.yapfArgs&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;--style&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">&quot;pep8&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="using-version-control-systems">Using Version Control Systems</h3>
<p>Version control systems like Git are essential for open source contribution. Git allows you to track changes to your code, collaborate with other developers, and manage different versions of your project.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to use Git to contribute to an open source project:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># Clone the project&#39;s repository</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>clone<span class="w"> </span>https://github.com/project/repository.git

<span class="c1"># Create a new branch for your contribution</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>checkout<span class="w"> </span>-b<span class="w"> </span>my-contribution

<span class="c1"># Make changes to the project&#39;s code</span>
<span class="c1"># ...</span>

<span class="c1"># Commit your changes</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>add<span class="w"> </span>.
git<span class="w"> </span>commit<span class="w"> </span>-m<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;My contribution&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># Push your changes to the project&#39;s repository</span>
git<span class="w"> </span>push<span class="w"> </span>origin<span class="w"> </span>my-contribution
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="contributing-code">Contributing Code</h2>
<p>Contributing code to an open source project involves making changes to the project's codebase and submitting a pull request. A pull request is a request to the project's maintainers to review and merge your changes into the project's main branch.</p>
<p>To contribute code, you'll need to:
1. Fork the project's repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Make changes to the project's code
4. Commit your changes
5. Push your changes to the forked repository
6. Submit a pull request to the project's maintainers</p>
<p>Here's an example of how to contribute code to the React project:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// react/src/components/Button.js</span>
<span class="k">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">React</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;react&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Button</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">button</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Click</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">me</span><span class="o">!&lt;</span><span class="err">/button&gt;;</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">default</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Button</span><span class="p">;</span>
