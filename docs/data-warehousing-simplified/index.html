<li>Google Cloud Dataflow: a fully managed service that provides batch and streaming data processing</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some metrics to consider when evaluating data ingestion and integration tools:
* Data throughput: the amount of data that can be processed per unit of time
* Data latency: the time it takes for data to be processed and available for analysis
* Data quality: the accuracy and consistency of the data being processed</p>
<p>For example, Apache NiFi provides a data throughput of up to 100,000 events per second, with data latency of less than 1 second. AWS Glue provides a data throughput of up to 10,000 records per second, with data latency of less than 1 minute.</p>
<h2 id="data-security-and-governance">Data Security and Governance</h2>
<p>Data security and governance are critical components of a data warehousing solution. There are several tools and services available that can help with data security and governance, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Apache Ranger: an open-source data governance tool that provides data access control and auditing</li>
<li>Apache Knox: an open-source data security tool that provides data encryption and authentication</li>
<li>AWS IAM: a fully managed identity and access management service that provides data access control and auditing</li>
<li>Google Cloud IAM: a fully managed identity and access management service that provides data access control and auditing</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some best practices to consider when implementing data security and governance:
* Implement data encryption and authentication
* Use role-based access control to restrict data access
* Monitor data access and usage
* Implement data retention and deletion policies</p>
<p>For example, Apache Ranger provides role-based access control, with support for data encryption and authentication. AWS IAM provides role-based access control, with support for data encryption and authentication.</p>
