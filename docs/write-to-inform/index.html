* <strong>Conditional text</strong>: Enables writers to create content that is tailored to specific audiences or contexts.
* <strong>Integration with other tools</strong>: Supports integration with other tools and platforms, such as version control systems and content management systems.</p>
<h3 id="code-examples">Code Examples</h3>
<p>To demonstrate the power of technical writing, let's consider a few code examples. The following code snippet is an example of a simple Python function that calculates the area of a rectangle:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">calculate_area</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">width</span><span class="p">):</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="sd">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="sd">    Calculate the area of a rectangle.</span>

<span class="sd">    Args:</span>
<span class="sd">        length (float): The length of the rectangle.</span>
<span class="sd">        width (float): The width of the rectangle.</span>

<span class="sd">    Returns:</span>
<span class="sd">        float: The area of the rectangle.</span>
<span class="sd">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">length</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="n">width</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code snippet demonstrates several key principles of technical writing, including:
* <strong>Clear and concise comments</strong>: The comments explain the purpose of the function, its arguments, and its return value.
* <strong>Accurate and complete documentation</strong>: The docstring provides a complete description of the function, including its parameters and return value.
* <strong>Consistent formatting</strong>: The code is formatted consistently, with clear and concise naming conventions.</p>
<p>Another example is a JavaScript function that calculates the sum of an array of numbers:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="cm">/**</span>
<span class="cm"> * Calculate the sum of an array of numbers.</span>
<span class="cm"> *</span>
<span class="cm"> * @param {number[]} numbers - The array of numbers to sum.</span>
<span class="cm"> * @returns {number} The sum of the numbers.</span>
<span class="cm"> */</span>
<span class="kd">function</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">calculateSum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">numbers</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">sum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">for</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">let</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">numbers</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nx">sum</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">numbers</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">sum</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code snippet demonstrates several key principles of technical writing, including:
* <strong>Clear and concise comments</strong>: The comments explain the purpose of the function, its parameters, and its return value.
* <strong>Accurate and complete documentation</strong>: The JSDoc comment provides a complete description of the function, including its parameters and return value.
