<p>This code defines a simple pipeline that ingests data, validates it, and trains a model. The <code>tfx</code> library takes care of the underlying details, making it easy to create and deploy machine learning pipelines.</p>
<h2 id="deploying-machine-learning-models">Deploying Machine Learning Models</h2>
<p>Deploying machine learning models is a critical step in the MLOps process. This involves serving the model in a production environment, where it can be accessed by users. One popular option for deploying machine learning models is TensorFlow Serving. Here is an example of how to deploy a model using TensorFlow Serving:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">tensorflow_serving.api</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">serving_util</span>

    <span class="s1">&#39;example_model&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s1">&#39;http://localhost:8501&#39;</span>
<span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code loads a trained model, creates a TensorFlow Serving signature, and deploys the model to a local server.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-and-maintaining-machine-learning-models">Monitoring and Maintaining Machine Learning Models</h2>
<p>Monitoring and maintaining machine learning models is essential to ensure that they continue to perform well over time. This involves tracking metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall, as well as monitoring for data drift and concept drift. One popular option for monitoring machine learning models is Prometheus. Here is an example of how to monitor a model using Prometheus:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">prometheus_client</span>

<span class="c1"># Define a Prometheus metric</span>
<span class="n">accuracy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">prometheus_client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Gauge</span><span class="p">(</span>

<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Update the metric</span>
<span class="n">accuracy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">labels</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">model_name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;example_model&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">0.9</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code defines a Prometheus metric for tracking model accuracy and updates the metric with a value of 0.9.</p>
<h2 id="common-problems-and-solutions">Common Problems and Solutions</h2>
<p>There are several common problems that can occur when implementing MLOps. Here are some solutions to these problems:
