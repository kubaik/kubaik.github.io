                    <h2 id="introduction-to-apache-kafka">Introduction to Apache Kafka</h2>
<p>Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that is widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It was originally developed by LinkedIn and is now maintained by the Apache Software Foundation. Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput and provides low-latency, fault-tolerant, and scalable data processing.</p>
<p>Kafka is often used in conjunction with other big data technologies such as Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink. It is also used in a variety of industries, including finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, to process and analyze large amounts of data in real-time.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-kafka">Key Features of Kafka</h3>
<p>Some of the key features of Kafka include:
* <strong>High-throughput</strong>: Kafka is designed to handle high-throughput and can process thousands of messages per second.
* <strong>Low-latency</strong>: Kafka provides low-latency data processing, with typical latency of less than 10ms.
* <strong>Fault-tolerant</strong>: Kafka is designed to be fault-tolerant and can handle failures of individual nodes in the cluster.
* <strong>Scalable</strong>: Kafka is highly scalable and can handle large amounts of data and high-throughput applications.
* <strong>Flexible data model</strong>: Kafka supports a flexible data model, allowing for a wide range of data formats and schemas.</p>
<h2 id="kafka-streams">Kafka Streams</h2>
<p>Kafka Streams is a Java library that provides a simple and intuitive API for building streaming applications on top of Kafka. It provides a high-level abstraction over the Kafka API, allowing developers to focus on the logic of their application without worrying about the underlying details of Kafka.</p>
<p>Kafka Streams provides a number of features, including:
* <strong>Stream processing</strong>: Kafka Streams allows developers to process streams of data in real-time, using a variety of operations such as mapping, filtering, and aggregation.
* <strong>Windowing</strong>: Kafka Streams provides support for windowing, allowing developers to process data over a fixed window of time.
* <strong>Joins</strong>: Kafka Streams provides support for joining multiple streams of data together, allowing developers to combine data from multiple sources.
* <strong>Stateful processing</strong>: Kafka Streams provides support for stateful processing, allowing developers to maintain state across multiple messages.</p>
