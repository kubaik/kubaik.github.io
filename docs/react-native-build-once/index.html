                    <h2 id="introduction-to-react-native">Introduction to React Native</h2>
<p>React Native is a popular framework for building cross-platform mobile applications using JavaScript and React. It allows developers to build native mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms using a single codebase. This approach has gained significant traction in recent years, with many companies adopting React Native to reduce development time and costs.</p>
<p>One of the primary advantages of React Native is its ability to reuse code across platforms. According to a survey by App Annie, the average cost of developing a mobile app can range from $100,000 to $500,000 or more, depending on the complexity of the app. By using React Native, developers can reduce this cost by up to 30%, as they only need to maintain a single codebase.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-react-native">Key Features of React Native</h3>
<p>Some of the key features of React Native include:
* <strong>Cross-platform compatibility</strong>: React Native allows developers to build apps that run on both Android and iOS platforms.
* <strong>Native performance</strong>: React Native apps have native performance, which means they are as fast and responsive as native apps built using Java or Swift.
* <strong>JavaScript and React</strong>: React Native uses JavaScript and React, which makes it easy for web developers to transition to mobile app development.
* <strong>Large community</strong>: React Native has a large and active community, which means there are many resources available for learning and troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-react-native-app">Building a React Native App</h2>
<p>To build a React Native app, you'll need to have Node.js and the React Native CLI installed on your machine. You can install the React Native CLI using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>npm<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>-g<span class="w"> </span>react-native-cli
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once you have the CLI installed, you can create a new React Native project using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>npx<span class="w"> </span>react-native<span class="w"> </span>init<span class="w"> </span>MyReactNativeApp
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a new React Native project called MyReactNativeApp.</p>
<h3 id="project-structure">Project Structure</h3>
<p>The project structure of a React Native app is similar to that of a React web app. The main components of a React Native app include:
* <strong>App.js</strong>: This is the main entry point of the app, where you'll define the app's layout and navigation.
* <strong>Components</strong>: These are reusable UI components that can be used throughout the app.
* <strong>Screens</strong>: These are the individual screens of the app, such as the login screen or the home screen.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a simple React Native component:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// MyComponent.js</span>
<span class="k">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">React</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;react&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">View</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Text</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;react-native&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">MyComponent</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">View</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">Text</span><span class="p">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Hello</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">World</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">Text</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">View</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">default</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">MyComponent</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can then use this component in your App.js file like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1">// App.js</span>
<span class="k">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">React</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;react&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">MyComponent</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;./MyComponent&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">App</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">return</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">MyComponent</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">/&gt;</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">};</span>

<span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">default</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">;</span>
</code></pre></div>
