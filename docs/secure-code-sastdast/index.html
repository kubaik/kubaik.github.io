                    <h2 id="introduction-to-application-security-testing">Introduction to Application Security Testing</h2>
<p>Application Security Testing (AST) is a critical process in ensuring the security and integrity of software applications. There are two primary types of AST: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). In this article, we will delve into the world of SAST and DAST, exploring their differences, benefits, and implementation details.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-sast">What is SAST?</h3>
<p>SAST involves analyzing the source code of an application to identify potential security vulnerabilities. This is typically done using automated tools that scan the code for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows. SAST tools can be integrated into the development pipeline, allowing developers to identify and fix security issues early in the development process.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider a simple Python application that uses a SQL database:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sqlite3</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_user_data</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;database.db&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = &#39;&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">username</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&#39;&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetchall</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A SAST tool such as Veracode or Checkmarx would identify this vulnerability and provide recommendations for fixing it. For instance, the tool might suggest using parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input into the query string:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">sqlite3</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">get_user_data</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="n">conn</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sqlite3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;database.db&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">conn</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cursor</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">query</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?&quot;</span>
    <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">execute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">query</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">username</span><span class="p">,))</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">cursor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fetchall</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3 id="what-is-dast">What is DAST?</h3>
<p>DAST, on the other hand, involves analyzing the running application to identify potential security vulnerabilities. This is typically done using automated tools that simulate attacks on the application, such as attempting to inject malicious input or exploit known vulnerabilities. DAST tools can be used to test web applications, mobile applications, and APIs.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider a web application that uses a login form:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">form</span> <span class="na">action</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;/login&quot;</span> <span class="na">method</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;post&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;text&quot;</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;username&quot;</span> <span class="na">placeholder</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;Username&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">input</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;password&quot;</span> <span class="na">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;password&quot;</span> <span class="na">placeholder</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;Password&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
    <span class="p">&lt;</span><span class="nt">button</span> <span class="na">type</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s">&quot;submit&quot;</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>Login<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">button</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
<span class="p">&lt;/</span><span class="nt">form</span><span class="p">&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A DAST tool such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite would simulate attacks on this login form, such as attempting to inject malicious input or exploit known vulnerabilities. The tool might identify vulnerabilities such as XSS or CSRF, and provide recommendations for fixing them.</p>
