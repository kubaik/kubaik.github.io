                    <h2 id="introduction-to-application-security-testing">Introduction to Application Security Testing</h2>
<p>Application Security Testing (AST) is a critical process in ensuring the security and integrity of software applications. It involves analyzing the application's code, configuration, and runtime environment to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers. There are two primary types of AST: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). In this article, we will delve into the details of SAST and DAST, exploring their differences, benefits, and implementation details.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-sast">What is SAST?</h3>
<p>SAST involves analyzing the application's source code, byte code, or binaries to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This type of testing is typically performed during the development phase, allowing developers to identify and fix security issues early on. SAST tools can be integrated into the development environment, such as IDEs, to provide real-time feedback and guidance on secure coding practices.</p>
<p>Some popular SAST tools include:
* Veracode, which offers a comprehensive platform for identifying vulnerabilities and providing remediation guidance, with pricing starting at $1,500 per year
* Checkmarx, which provides a robust SAST solution with advanced analytics and reporting capabilities, with pricing starting at $10,000 per year
* SonarQube, which offers a free, open-source SAST platform with a wide range of plugins and integrations, with premium features starting at $150 per month</p>
<h3 id="what-is-dast">What is DAST?</h3>
<p>DAST involves analyzing the application's runtime environment to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses. This type of testing is typically performed during the testing or production phase, allowing testers to identify security issues that may have been missed during the development phase. DAST tools simulate real-world attacks on the application, providing a more comprehensive understanding of its security posture.</p>
<p>Some popular DAST tools include:
* OWASP ZAP, which offers a free, open-source DAST platform with a wide range of features and plugins, with commercial support available
* Burp Suite, which provides a comprehensive DAST solution with advanced analytics and reporting capabilities, with pricing starting at $400 per year
* Acunetix, which offers a robust DAST platform with advanced vulnerability scanning and penetration testing capabilities, with pricing starting at $1,000 per year</p>
<h2 id="practical-examples-of-sast-and-dast">Practical Examples of SAST and DAST</h2>
<p>Let's take a look at some practical examples of SAST and DAST in action.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-sast-with-veracode">Example 1: SAST with Veracode</h3>
<p>Suppose we have a simple Java application that uses a vulnerable version of the Apache Commons FileUpload library. We can use Veracode to analyze the application's source code and identify the vulnerability.</p>

<h3 id="example-2-dast-with-owasp-zap">Example 2: DAST with OWASP ZAP</h3>
<p>Suppose we have a web application that uses a SQL database to store user credentials. We can use OWASP ZAP to simulate a SQL injection attack on the application.</p>
