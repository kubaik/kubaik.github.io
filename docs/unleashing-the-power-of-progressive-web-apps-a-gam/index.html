                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have revolutionized the mobile technology landscape by combining the best features of web and mobile applications. They offer a seamless user experience, offline capabilities, and fast performance—all without the need for installation from an app store. In this blog post, we will delve into the world of PWAs, exploring their benefits, features, and how they are shaping the future of mobile development.</p>
<h2>What are Progressive Web Apps?</h2>

<li><strong>Fast Loading:</strong> PWAs load quickly, providing a smooth and engaging user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> PWAs can send push notifications to users, keeping them engaged even when the app is not open.</li>
