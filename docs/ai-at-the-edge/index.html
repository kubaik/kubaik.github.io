                    <h2 id="introduction-to-edge-computing">Introduction to Edge Computing</h2>
<p>Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings computation closer to the source of data, reducing latency and improving real-time processing. With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, edge computing has become a necessity for applications that require low latency, high bandwidth, and real-time processing. Artificial Intelligence (AI) at the edge is a natural extension of edge computing, where AI models are deployed on edge devices to enable real-time decision-making and intelligent processing.</p>
<h3 id="benefits-of-ai-at-the-edge">Benefits of AI at the Edge</h3>
<p>The benefits of AI at the edge are numerous:
* Reduced latency: By processing data at the edge, latency is significantly reduced, enabling real-time decision-making.
* Improved real-time processing: AI models can process data in real-time, enabling applications such as object detection, facial recognition, and natural language processing.
* Increased security: By processing data at the edge, sensitive data is not transmitted to the cloud, reducing the risk of data breaches.
* Enhanced reliability: Edge devices can operate even when connectivity to the cloud is lost, ensuring continuous operation.</p>
