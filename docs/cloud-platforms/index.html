<p>Let's take a look at some practical examples of cloud computing platforms in action. For example, let's say we want to deploy a web application on AWS. We can use the following code to create an AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">boto3</span>

<span class="n">beanstalk</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">boto3</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">client</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;elasticbeanstalk&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">beanstalk</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_environment</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">EnvironmentName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;my-environment&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">ApplicationName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;my-application&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">VersionLabel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;my-version&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">SolutionStackName</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;64bit Amazon Linux 2018.03 v2.12.10 running Docker 18.09.7&#39;</span>
<span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nb">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code creates a new AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment with the specified name, application, version, and solution stack.</p>
<p>Another example is using Microsoft Azure to deploy a containerized application. We can use the following code to create an Azure Container Instance:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">os</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">azure.containerinstance</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">ContainerGroup</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">Container</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">ContainerPort</span>

<span class="c1"># Create a container group</span>
<span class="n">group</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">ContainerGroup</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">location</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;westus&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">containers</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="p">[</span>
