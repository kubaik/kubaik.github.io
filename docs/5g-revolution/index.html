* <strong>Education</strong>: 5G can enable online learning, virtual reality, and augmented reality experiences.</p>
<h3 id="practical-example-implementing-5g-in-healthcare">Practical Example: Implementing 5G in Healthcare</h3>
<p>Let's take a look at a practical example of how 5G can be implemented in healthcare. Suppose we want to build a telemedicine platform that enables remote patient monitoring and consultation. We can use a platform like <strong>AWS IoT Core</strong> to connect medical devices, such as blood pressure monitors and glucose meters, to the cloud. We can then use <strong>AWS Lambda</strong> to process the data and trigger alerts and notifications to healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Here's an example code snippet in Python that demonstrates how to use AWS IoT Core to connect a medical device to the cloud:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">boto3</span>

<span class="c1"># Create an IoT Core client</span>
