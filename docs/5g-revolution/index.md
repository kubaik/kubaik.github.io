## Code Examples
Here are a few code examples that demonstrate the use of 5G technology:
### Example 1: 5G Network Slicing
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the network slicing parameters
num_slices = 5
slice_bandwidth = 100  # in MHz

# Calculate the total bandwidth required
total_bandwidth = num_slices * slice_bandwidth

# Print the total bandwidth required
print("Total bandwidth required:", total_bandwidth, "MHz")
```
This code example demonstrates how to calculate the total bandwidth required for network slicing in a 5G network.

### Example 2: 5G QoS Management
```python
import pandas as pd

# Define the QoS parameters
qos_params = {
    "latency": 10,  # in ms
    "jitter": 5,  # in ms
    "packet_loss": 0.01  # in percentage
}

# Create a DataFrame to store the QoS data
qos_data = pd.DataFrame(qos_params, index=[0])

# Print the QoS data
print(qos_data)
```
This code example demonstrates how to define and manage QoS parameters in a 5G network.

### Example 3: 5G Network Optimization
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the network optimization parameters
num_users = 1000
user_throughput = 10  # in Mbps

# Calculate the total throughput required
total_throughput = num_users * user_throughput

# Plot the total throughput required
plt.plot([1], [total_throughput])
plt.xlabel("Number of Users")
plt.ylabel("Total Throughput (Mbps)")
plt.show()
```
This code example demonstrates how to calculate and visualize the total throughput required in a 5G network.
