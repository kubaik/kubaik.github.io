* <strong>Cloud Datastore</strong>: a NoSQL database service that allows developers to store and manage structured and semi-structured data.</p>
<h2 id="practical-example-deploying-a-web-application-on-app-engine">Practical Example: Deploying a Web Application on App Engine</h2>
<p>To deploy a web application on App Engine, you need to create a new project, enable the App Engine service, and upload your application code. Here is an example of how to deploy a simple Python web application using the App Engine SDK:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">flask</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">Flask</span>
<span class="n">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Flask</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="vm">__name__</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="nd">@app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">route</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;/&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">hello</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>

<span class="k">if</span> <span class="vm">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;__main__&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">run</span><span class="p">()</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>To deploy this application, you need to create a new file called <code>app.yaml</code> with the following contents:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">runtime</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">python37</span>
<span class="n">instance_class</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">F1</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can then deploy the application using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>gcloud<span class="w"> </span>app<span class="w"> </span>deploy
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will deploy the application to the App Engine service, and you can access it by visiting the URL <code>https://&lt;project-id&gt;.appspot.com</code>.</p>
<h2 id="storage-services">Storage Services</h2>
<p>GCP offers a range of storage services that allow users to store and serve data. These include:
* <strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: an object storage service that allows users to store and serve large amounts of data.

<h3 id="pricing-and-performance">Pricing and Performance</h3>
<p>The pricing for GCP storage services varies depending on the service and the amount of data stored. For example, Cloud Storage costs $0.026 per GB-month for standard storage, while Cloud Datastore costs $0.18 per GB-month for stored data. In terms of performance, GCP storage services offer high throughput and low latency. For example, Cloud Storage can handle up to 100,000 requests per second, while Cloud Datastore can handle up to 10,000 writes per second.</p>
<h2 id="machine-learning-services">Machine Learning Services</h2>
<p>GCP offers a range of machine learning services that allow developers to build and deploy machine learning models. These include:
* <strong>Cloud AI Platform</strong>: a managed platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models.
* <strong>AutoML</strong>: a service that allows developers to build machine learning models using automated machine learning.
* <strong>TensorFlow</strong>: an open-source machine learning framework that allows developers to build and deploy machine learning models.</p>
<h3 id="practical-example-building-a-machine-learning-model-using-automl">Practical Example: Building a Machine Learning Model using AutoML</h3>
<p>To build a machine learning model using AutoML, you need to create a new dataset, upload your data, and train a model. Here is an example of how to build a simple machine learning model using AutoML:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">google.cloud</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">automl</span>

<span class="c1"># Create a new dataset</span>
<span class="n">dataset</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">automl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Dataset</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;my-dataset&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Upload data to the dataset</span>
<span class="n">data</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;example1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;example2&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;example3&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">example</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">data</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">automl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Dataset</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">add_example</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dataset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">example</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Train a model</span>
<span class="n">model</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">automl</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Model</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">train</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dataset</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;my-model&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will train a machine learning model using the data in the dataset, and you can use the model to make predictions on new data.</p>
<h2 id="security-and-identity">Security and Identity</h2>
<p>GCP offers a range of security and identity services that allow developers to secure their applications and data. These include:

<h3 id="practical-example-creating-a-virtual-network-using-vpc">Practical Example: Creating a Virtual Network using VPC</h3>
<p>To create a virtual network using VPC, you need to create a new network, add subnets, and configure firewall rules. Here is an example of how to create a simple virtual network using VPC:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">google.cloud</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">compute</span>

<span class="c1"># Create a new network</span>
<span class="n">network</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">compute</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Network</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;my-network&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Add subnets to the network</span>
<span class="n">subnet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">compute</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">Subnetwork</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;my-subnet&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">network</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Configure firewall rules</span>
<span class="n">firewall_rule</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">compute</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">FirewallRule</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;my-firewall-rule&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">network</span><span class="p">)</span>
