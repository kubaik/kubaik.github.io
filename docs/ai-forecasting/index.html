                    <h2 id="introduction-to-time-series-forecasting">Introduction to Time Series Forecasting</h2>
<p>Time series forecasting is a technique used to predict future values based on historical data. It has numerous applications in finance, weather forecasting, and demand planning. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), time series forecasting has become more accurate and efficient. In this article, we will explore the concepts of time series forecasting with AI, its applications, and practical implementation using popular tools and platforms.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-time-series-forecasting">Types of Time Series Forecasting</h3>
<p>There are several types of time series forecasting, including:
* <strong>Autoregressive (AR)</strong>: uses past values to forecast future values
* <strong>Moving Average (MA)</strong>: uses the errors (residuals) from past forecasts to forecast future values
* <strong>Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA)</strong>: combines AR and MA models
* <strong>Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)</strong>: accounts for seasonal patterns in the data
* <strong>Exponential Smoothing (ES)</strong>: uses weighted averages of past observations to forecast future values</p>
<h2 id="ai-powered-time-series-forecasting">AI-Powered Time Series Forecasting</h2>
<p>AI-powered time series forecasting uses machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of forecasts. Some popular AI-powered time series forecasting techniques include:
* <strong>LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks</strong>: a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time series forecasting
* <strong>GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Networks</strong>: another type of RNN suitable for time series forecasting
* <strong>Prophet</strong>: an open-source software for forecasting time series data</p>
<h3 id="practical-implementation-with-python">Practical Implementation with Python</h3>

<p>This code snippet uses the LSTM Network to forecast a time series dataset. We first load and scale the data, then split it into training and testing sets. We create an LSTM model, compile it, and train it on the training data. Finally, we evaluate the model on the testing data and print the mean squared error (MSE).</p>
