<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ng<span class="w"> </span>new<span class="w"> </span>my-app
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a new Angular application with a basic directory structure and configuration files. We can then use the Angular CLI to generate new components, services, and other features as needed. For example, to generate a new component, we can use the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>ng<span class="w"> </span>generate<span class="w"> </span>component<span class="w"> </span>my-component
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a new component with a basic template and class file.</p>
<h2 id="implementing-security-features-in-angular-enterprise-applications">Implementing Security Features in Angular Enterprise Applications</h2>
<p>Security is a critical aspect of any enterprise application, and Angular provides a range of features and tools to help protect applications from common web attacks. Some best practices for implementing security features in Angular applications include:
* <strong>Using HTTPS</strong>: All Angular applications should use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
* <strong>Validating user input</strong>: Angular applications should always validate user input to prevent XSS and other types of attacks.
* <strong>Implementing authentication and authorization</strong>: Angular applications should implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive data and features.</p>
<h3 id="example-implementing-authentication-with-okta">Example: Implementing Authentication with Okta</h3>
<p>Okta is a popular authentication platform that provides a range of tools and services for managing user identities and access. To implement authentication with Okta in an Angular application, we can use the Okta Angular SDK. Here is an example of how to configure the Okta Angular SDK:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">OktaAuthService</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;@okta/okta-angular&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">@NgModule</span><span class="p">({</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">declarations</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">AppComponent</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">imports</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">BrowserModule</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">OktaAuthService</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">providers</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">provide</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">OKTA_CONFIG</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">useValue</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="nx">clientId</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;your-client-id&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="nx">issuer</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;https://your-issuer.okta.com&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="w">      </span><span class="nx">redirectUri</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;http://localhost:4200&#39;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">}}</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">bootstrap</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">AppComponent</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">})</span>
<span class="k">export</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kd">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">AppModule</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will configure the Okta Angular SDK with our client ID, issuer, and redirect URI.</p>
<h2 id="optimizing-performance-in-angular-enterprise-applications">Optimizing Performance in Angular Enterprise Applications</h2>
<p>Performance is critical for any enterprise application, and Angular provides a range of tools and features to help optimize application performance. Some best practices for optimizing performance in Angular applications include:
