                    <h2 id="introduction-to-progressive-web-apps">Introduction to Progressive Web Apps</h2>
<p>Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) have revolutionized the way we interact with web applications, providing a native app-like experience to users. According to a study by Google, PWAs can increase user engagement by 137% and conversion rates by 52%. In this article, we will delve into the world of PWAs, exploring their features, benefits, and implementation details.</p>
<h3 id="key-features-of-pwas">Key Features of PWAs</h3>
<p>PWAs are built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and provide the following key features:
* <strong>Responsive design</strong>: PWAs are designed to work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.
* <strong>Offline capabilities</strong>: PWAs can function offline or with a slow internet connection, providing a better user experience.
* <strong>Push notifications</strong>: PWAs can send push notifications to users, even when the app is not open.
* <strong>Home screen installation</strong>: PWAs can be installed on a user's home screen, providing easy access to the app.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-pwa">Building a PWA</h2>
<p>To build a PWA, you will need to create a web app that meets the following requirements:
1. <strong>HTTPS</strong>: Your web app must be served over HTTPS.
2. <strong>Service worker</strong>: Your web app must have a service worker that handles offline requests and push notifications.
3. <strong>Web manifest</strong>: Your web app must have a web manifest that provides metadata about the app.</p>
<h3 id="service-worker-example">Service Worker Example</h3>
<p>Here is an example of a basic service worker that handles offline requests:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">Recommended</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">a</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;https://amazon.com/dp/B07C3KLQWX?tag=aiblogcontent-20&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">target</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;_blank&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">rel</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;nofollow sponsored&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="nx">Eloquent</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">JavaScript</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">Book</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/a&gt;*</span>
