<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">nltk.sentiment.vader</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">SentimentIntensityAnalyzer</span>

<span class="c1"># Load the text data</span>
<span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;I love this product! It is amazing.&quot;</span>

<span class="c1"># Create a SentimentIntensityAnalyzer object</span>
<span class="n">sia</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">SentimentIntensityAnalyzer</span><span class="p">()</span>

<span class="c1"># Analyze the sentiment of the text</span>
<span class="n">sentiment</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">sia</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">polarity_scores</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="p">)</span>

<h3 id="example-3-named-entity-recognition">Example 3: Named Entity Recognition</h3>
<p>Named entity recognition is the process of identifying named entities in text. Here is an example of how to use spaCy to perform named entity recognition:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">spacy</span>

<span class="c1"># Load the spaCy model</span>
<span class="n">nlp</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">spacy</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;en_core_web_sm&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># Load the text data</span>
<span class="n">text</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Apple is a technology company. It is headquartered in Cupertino, California.&quot;</span>
