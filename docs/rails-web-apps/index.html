<h2 id="building-a-rails-application">Building a Rails Application</h2>
<p>To build a Rails application, you will need to have Ruby and Rails installed on your system. You can install Rails using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>gem<span class="w"> </span>install<span class="w"> </span>rails
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once Rails is installed, you can create a new application using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>rails<span class="w"> </span>new<span class="w"> </span>myapp
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will create a new directory called <code>myapp</code> with the basic structure for a Rails application.</p>
<h3 id="directory-structure">Directory Structure</h3>
<p>The directory structure of a Rails application is as follows:
* <strong>app</strong>: This directory contains the application code, including models, views, and controllers.
* <strong>config</strong>: This directory contains configuration files, including database configuration and routing information.
* <strong>db</strong>: This directory contains the database schema and migration files.
* <strong>lib</strong>: This directory contains library code, including custom modules and classes.
* <strong>log</strong>: This directory contains log files for the application.
* <strong>public</strong>: This directory contains static files, including images, CSS, and JavaScript files.
* <strong>test</strong>: This directory contains test files for the application.</p>
<h2 id="models-views-and-controllers">Models, Views, and Controllers</h2>
<p>In a Rails application, the code is organized into three main components: models, views, and controllers.</p>
<h3 id="models">Models</h3>
<p>Models represent the data structures used in the application. In Rails, models are typically defined as classes that inherit from <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code>. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># app/models/user.rb</span>
<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">User</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">ApplicationRecord</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">validates</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">:name</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">presence</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="n">validates</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">:email</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">presence</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kp">true</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="ss">uniqueness</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kp">true</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code defines a <code>User</code> model with two attributes: <code>name</code> and <code>email</code>. The <code>validates</code> method is used to specify validation rules for the attributes.</p>
<h3 id="views">Views</h3>
<p>Views represent the user interface of the application. In Rails, views are typically defined as ERb (Embedded RuBy) templates. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="x">&lt;!-- app/views/users/index.html.erb --&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;h1&gt;Users&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;ul&gt;</span>
<span class="x">  </span><span class="cp">&lt;%</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="vi">@users</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">each</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">do</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
<span class="x">    &lt;li&gt;</span><span class="cp">&lt;%=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="cp">%&gt;</span><span class="x">&lt;/li&gt;</span>
<span class="x">  &lt;/ul&gt;</span>
<span class="x">&lt;/ul&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code defines a view that displays a list of users.</p>
<h3 id="controllers">Controllers</h3>
<p>Controllers represent the business logic of the application. In Rails, controllers are typically defined as classes that inherit from <code>ApplicationController</code>. For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="c1"># app/controllers/users_controller.rb</span>
<span class="k">class</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">UsersController</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">ApplicationController</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">def</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">index</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="vi">@users</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">User</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">all</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code defines a <code>UsersController</code> with an <code>index</code> action that retrieves a list of all users.</p>
<h2 id="deployment-options">Deployment Options</h2>
<p>There are several options for deploying a Rails application, including:
* <strong>Heroku</strong>: Heroku is a cloud platform that provides a managed environment for deploying Rails applications. Pricing starts at $25 per month for a basic plan.
* <strong>AWS</strong>: AWS provides a range of services, including EC2, RDS, and S3, that can be used to deploy a Rails application. Pricing varies depending on the services used, but a basic plan can start at around $10 per month.
* <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>: DigitalOcean is a cloud platform that provides a managed environment for deploying Rails applications. Pricing starts at $5 per month for a basic plan.</p>
<h3 id="performance-benchmarks">Performance Benchmarks</h3>
<p>The performance of a Rails application can vary depending on the deployment environment and the specific use case. However, here are some general performance benchmarks for a Rails application:
* <strong>Request/response time</strong>: 50-100ms
* <strong>Memory usage</strong>: 100-200MB
* <strong>CPU usage</strong>: 10-20%</p>
<h2 id="common-problems-and-solutions">Common Problems and Solutions</h2>
<p>Some common problems that can occur when building a Rails application include:
* <strong>Slow performance</strong>: This can be caused by a number of factors, including poor database design, inefficient queries, and insufficient caching. To solve this problem, use tools like New Relic or Rails Analyzer to identify performance bottlenecks, and optimize database queries and caching accordingly.
