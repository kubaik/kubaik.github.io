                    <h2 id="introduction-to-etl-and-elt">Introduction to ETL and ELT</h2>
<p>Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) and Extract, Load, Transform (ELT) are two data integration processes used to transfer data from multiple sources to a centralized data warehouse. The primary difference between ETL and ELT lies in when the transformation step occurs. In ETL, data is transformed before loading it into the target system, whereas in ELT, data is loaded into the target system and then transformed.</p>
<p>Both ETL and ELT have their own strengths and weaknesses. ETL is suitable for smaller datasets and can be more efficient when dealing with simple transformations. On the other hand, ELT is more scalable and can handle complex transformations, making it a better choice for big data and real-time analytics.</p>
<h3 id="etl-process">ETL Process</h3>
<p>The ETL process involves the following steps:
* Extract: Data is extracted from multiple sources, such as databases, files, and applications.
* Transform: The extracted data is transformed into a standardized format, which includes data cleansing, data aggregation, and data filtering.
* Load: The transformed data is loaded into the target system, such as a data warehouse.</p>
<p>For example, consider a company that wants to analyze customer data from its e-commerce platform, social media, and customer relationship management (CRM) system. The ETL process would involve extracting data from these sources, transforming it into a standardized format, and loading it into a data warehouse like Amazon Redshift.</p>

<h2 id="elt-process">ELT Process</h2>
<p>The ELT process involves the following steps:
* Extract: Data is extracted from multiple sources, such as databases, files, and applications.
* Load: The extracted data is loaded into the target system, such as a data warehouse.
* Transform: The loaded data is transformed into a standardized format, which includes data cleansing, data aggregation, and data filtering.</p>
<p>For instance, consider a company that wants to analyze log data from its web servers. The ELT process would involve extracting log data from the web servers, loading it into a data warehouse like Google BigQuery, and then transforming it into a standardized format using SQL queries.</p>
