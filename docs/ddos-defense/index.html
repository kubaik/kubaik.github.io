                    <h2 id="introduction-to-ddos-attacks">Introduction to DDoS Attacks</h2>
<p>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are a type of cyberattack where an attacker attempts to make a network resource or machine unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. This can be achieved by using a large number of compromised devices, such as computers, smartphones, or IoT devices, to flood the targeted system with traffic. According to a report by Verizon, the average cost of a DDoS attack is around $2.5 million, highlighting the need for effective DDoS protection strategies.</p>
<h3 id="types-of-ddos-attacks">Types of DDoS Attacks</h3>
<p>There are several types of DDoS attacks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Volumetric attacks</strong>: These attacks aim to overwhelm the targeted system with a large amount of traffic, typically measured in gigabits per second (Gbps). For example, in 2016, the DNS provider Dyn was hit with a volumetric attack that peaked at 1.2 Tbps.</li>
<li><strong>Application-layer attacks</strong>: These attacks target specific applications or services, such as web servers or databases, with the goal of overwhelming them with requests. According to a report by Akamai, the average application-layer attack peaks at around 10 Gbps.</li>
<li><strong>Protocol attacks</strong>: These attacks exploit vulnerabilities in network protocols, such as TCP or UDP, to overwhelm the targeted system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ddos-protection-strategies">DDoS Protection Strategies</h2>
<p>To protect against DDoS attacks, several strategies can be employed, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traffic filtering</strong>: This involves blocking traffic from known malicious IP addresses or traffic that matches certain patterns.</li>
<li><strong>Rate limiting</strong>: This involves limiting the amount of traffic that can be sent to a specific IP address or network.</li>
<li><strong>IP blocking</strong>: This involves blocking traffic from specific IP addresses or ranges.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some popular tools and platforms for DDoS protection include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cloudflare</strong>: A cloud-based platform that offers DDoS protection, content delivery network (CDN) services, and web application firewall (WAF) capabilities. Pricing starts at $20 per month for the Pro plan.</li>
<li><strong>AWS Shield</strong>: A DDoS protection service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that provides automatic traffic filtering and rate limiting. Pricing starts at $3,000 per month for the Advanced plan.</li>
<li><strong>Akamai</strong>: A cloud-based platform that offers DDoS protection, CDN services, and WAF capabilities. Pricing varies depending on the specific plan and services required.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="example-code-traffic-filtering-with-iptables">Example Code: Traffic Filtering with iptables</h3>
<p>The following example code demonstrates how to use iptables to block traffic from a specific IP address:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>iptables<span class="w"> </span>-A<span class="w"> </span>INPUT<span class="w"> </span>-s<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">192</span>.168.1.100<span class="w"> </span>-j<span class="w"> </span>DROP
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code adds a new rule to the INPUT chain that drops any traffic from the IP address 192.168.1.100.</p>
<h3 id="example-code-rate-limiting-with-apache">Example Code: Rate Limiting with Apache</h3>
<p>The following example code demonstrates how to use Apache to limit the amount of traffic that can be sent to a specific IP address:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nt">&lt;IfModule</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">mod_limitipconn.c</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;Location</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s">/}</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
<span class="w">        </span><span class="nb">LimitIPConn</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">10</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nt">&lt;/Location&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/IfModule&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This code limits the number of concurrent connections from a single IP address to 10.</p>
<h3 id="example-code-ip-blocking-with-python">Example Code: IP Blocking with Python</h3>
<p>The following example code demonstrates how to use Python to block traffic from a specific IP address:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">ipaddress</span>

<span class="c1"># Define the IP address to block</span>
