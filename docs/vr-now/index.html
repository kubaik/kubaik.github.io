                    <h2 id="introduction-to-virtual-reality">Introduction to Virtual Reality</h2>
<p>Virtual Reality (VR) has been gaining traction over the past few years, with significant advancements in hardware and software capabilities. The global VR market is projected to reach $44.7 billion by 2024, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.8% from 2019 to 2024. This growth is driven by the increasing adoption of VR technology in various industries, including gaming, education, healthcare, and entertainment.</p>
<p>One of the key drivers of VR adoption is the availability of affordable and high-quality VR headsets. For example, the Oculus Quest 2 starts at $299, while the HTC Vive Pro 2 starts at $1,399. The price difference is significant, but both headsets offer high-quality VR experiences. The Oculus Quest 2 has a resolution of 1832 x 1920 per eye, while the HTC Vive Pro 2 has a resolution of 1832 x 1920 per eye.</p>
<h3 id="vr-development-tools-and-platforms">VR Development Tools and Platforms</h3>
<p>There are several VR development tools and platforms available, including Unity, Unreal Engine, and A-Frame. Unity is one of the most popular game engines, with over 60% market share. It supports 2D and 3D game development, as well as VR and Augmented Reality (AR) development. Unity offers a free version, as well as several paid plans, including the Plus plan, which costs $399 per year, and the Pro plan, which costs $1,800 per year.</p>
<p>Unreal Engine is another popular game engine, known for its high-performance graphics capabilities. It is widely used in the gaming industry, but also supports VR and AR development. Unreal Engine offers a 5% royalty on gross revenue after the first $3,000 per product, per quarter.</p>
<p>A-Frame is an open-source framework for building VR experiences with HTML and CSS. It is a popular choice for web-based VR development, and offers a range of features, including support for 3D models, physics, and animations. A-Frame is free to use, and offers a range of community-driven tools and resources.</p>
