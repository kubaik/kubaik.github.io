<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">express</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;express&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">app</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;/users&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="c1">// Retrieve a list of users from the database</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">users</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;John Doe&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">},</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">id</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">&#39;Jane Doe&#39;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">];</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">json</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">users</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">listen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mf">3000</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;Server listening on port 3000&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">});</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>In this example, we're using Node.js and Express to build a simple RESTful API that retrieves a list of users from the database. We're using the <code>express</code> module to create an instance of the Express app, and defining a route for the <code>/users</code> endpoint using the <code>app.get()</code> method.</p>
<h2 id="strategic-thinking">Strategic Thinking</h2>
<p>Strategic thinking is another critical component of tech leadership. As a tech leader, you'll need to be able to align technical decisions with business objectives. This includes understanding the company's mission, vision, and goals, as well as the competitive landscape and market trends.</p>
<h3 id="example-using-aws-to-reduce-costs-and-improve-scalability">Example: Using AWS to Reduce Costs and Improve Scalability</h3>
<p>For example, let's say you're working at a company that's experiencing rapid growth and needs to reduce costs and improve scalability. You might consider using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host your application, as it provides a scalable and cost-effective solution. Here's an example of how you might use AWS to reduce costs and improve scalability:
